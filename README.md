# Emotion-Recognition-using-Facial-Mesh-Technology

Emotion recognition using facial mesh technology is an advanced approach to analyzing human emotions based on facial expressions. This method leverages facial landmarks and mesh structures to enhance the accuracy of emotion detection beyond traditional pixel-based image analysis.

How It Works:
Facial Landmark Detection – Key points on the face (such as eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth) are identified using deep learning models.

Mesh Construction – A structured mesh is created by connecting these landmarks, forming a detailed representation of facial movements.

Emotion Classification - The mesh data is processed using machine learning or deep learning models to classify emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise.
